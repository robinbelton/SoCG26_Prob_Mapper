This code is associated with the paper:

Probabilistic Statements for Mapper Graphs, submitted to SoCG 2026.

The experiments folder contains the experiments featured in the paper, plus an example of running experiments for estimating the probability of Mapper graph containing a square when DBSCAN clustering is used.
The prob_calculations folder contains a quarto document for calculating the probabilities mentioned in Section 4 of the paper.

The purpose of this code is to assist in review, provide reproducible research, and allow easy use of the methods discussed in the paper.
